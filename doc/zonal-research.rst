   ############# Paragraph (no number)

.. This is a suggested outline for adding new module documentation to |ns3|.
.. See ``src/click/doc/click.rst`` for an example.
..
.. The introductory paragraph is for describing what this code is trying to
.. model.
..
.. For consistency (italicized formatting), please use |ns3| to refer to
.. ns-3 in the documentation (and likewise, |ns2| for ns-2).  These macros
.. are defined in the file ``replace.txt``.

This code attempts to model a Zonal Automotive Ethernet architecture inside of 
a vehicle using the existing |ns3| abstractions. 

**TODO** - Expand on this documentation (most of the rest of this file is 
still a template).

You can find much more detailed documentation in the actual experiment and
supporting code files.
